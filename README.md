# NTDS_team51_BrainNetworks



This repository contains the code developed for the project 'BrainNetworks' of team 51 in the context of the 'A Network Tour of Data Science' NTDS2018 organized in EPFL.

The course description and material are available below:
http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/a-network-tour-of-data-science-EE-558 (Description) and https://github.com/mdeff/ntds_2018 (Material).


In this project, we use the theories and hands-on taught during the semester on a brain network dataset computed from MRI acquisitions. More specifically, we compare brain networks properties of a population of stroke patients between the acute and the chronic phases.

###  Codes
The different jupyter notebooks available are the codes associated to the results presented in the project report.

The notebook 'LongitudinalStudies_and_lesionImpactOnConnectome.ipynb' is associated to the 2nd and 3rd parts of the results 'Impact of the lesion on the connectome' and 'Longitudinal changes'.
The notebooks 'StatisticalAnalysis.ipynb' and 'OrdersDysconnectomes_codev2' are associated to the 1st part of the results 'Correlation between dysconnectome and clinical scores'.


###  Team
Our group is composed of 4 PhD students in Neurosciences:
Claudia Bigoni, Giorgia Evangelista, Emeline Mullier, Joan Rue
