# NTDS_team51_BrainNetworks



This repository contains the code developed for the project 'BrainNetworks' of team 51 in the context of the 'A Network Tour of Data Science' NTDS2018 organized in EPFL.

The course description and material are available below:
http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/a-network-tour-of-data-science-EE-558 (description) and https://github.com/mdeff/ntds_2018 (Material).


In this project, we use the theories and hands-on taught during the semester on a brain network dataset computed from MRI acquisitions. More specifically, we compare brain networks properties of a population of stroke patients between the acute and the chronic phases.
